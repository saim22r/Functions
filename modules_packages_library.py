# Python's extensive documentation on python.org
# - We have used functions that we have created as well as builtin
# - Import is the keyword that is used to import any module available in python.org

## math
import math
import random # generates a random number

num1 = 22.44 # Float

# In real life situations you will have to round the value
# If the value is less than .50 round down. If it is .51 or above then round up

print(math.ceil(num1))
print(math.floor(num1))
print(math.pi)

## Random class/methods
import random # generates a random number
print(random.random())
# - Generates a random number between 0 and .99 every time the program is run
