### Let's create a function
#### Syntax def is used to declare followed by name of the function():

# ## First Iteration
# def greeting():
#     print("Welcome")
#
# greeting() # You have to call the function to execute the code
#
# # pass is the keyword that allows the ineterpretor to skip without any errors
# # DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) declare functions and reuse code
#
# # Second Iteration (Use return statement)
# def greeting():
#     print("Good morning!")
#     return "Welcome"
# print(greeting())

## Third Iteration (With user name as a string as an argument)

# def greeting(name):
#     # print(name)
#     return "Welcome on Board " + name
#
# print(greeting("Saim"))

# - Create a function to prompt the user to enter their name and display the name back to the user with greeting message
#
# def greeting(name):
#     return "Welcome " + name + "!"
#
# print(greeting(input("What is your name? ")))

# Let's create a function with multiple args as an int

# def add(num1, num2):
#     return num1 + num2
#
# print(add(1, 3))
#
# def multiply(num1, num2):
#     return num1 * num2
#
# print(multiply(4, 3))

#- Return statement is the last line of code in a function
